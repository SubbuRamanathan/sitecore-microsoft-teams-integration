# Sitecore + Microsoft Teams Integration
This repository contains SPE Scripts, Config and Sitecore Items needed for sending Microsoft Teams Notifications for Sitecore Workflow Actions

## Purpose
The global shift to remote working poses a wide variety of challenges, from inevitable delays in content deliveries, communication transparency, to traceability, quality, efficiency, etc. Sitecore + Teams Integration connects teams in the new virtual workspace with its rich instant notifications, actions & valuable insights.

There are high chances for delays when the workflow approval hierarchy is complex involving multiple content authors/approvers. This will have huge impact in pushing time-sensitive updates to live site due to expected/unexpected communication delays. Automating this communication effectively through the business communication/collaboration platform along with quick actions(approve/reject/preview/edit), will help to avoid the delays and improve productivity of different teams. This module allows seamless integration of Sitecore Workflow and Publish events with Microsoft Teams.
