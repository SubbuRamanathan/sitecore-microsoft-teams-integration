## Purpose
There are high chances for delays when the workflow approval hierarchy is complex involving multiple content authors/approvers. This will have huge impact in pushing time-sensitive updates to live site due to expected/unexpected communication delays. Automating this communication effectively through the business communication/collaboration platform along with quick actions(approve/reject/preview/edit), will help to avoid the delays and improve productivity of different teams. This module allows seamless integration of Sitecore Workflow with Microsoft Teams.

## Prerequisites
Sitecore Powershell Extensions v5.0+ (https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console)
